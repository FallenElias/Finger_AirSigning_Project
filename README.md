## 🔎 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project aims to develop a contactless and secure way to sign documents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will create an application that uses computer vision techniques to identify finger-based signatures, with the objectives of accurately identifying and transcribing finger-based signatures and creating a user-friendly interface for signature creation and storage. The application will operate on both desktop and mobile devices and will be developed using existing technologies and frameworks such as OpenCV and TensorFlow. Other potential technologies that may be used include Unity, and Qt. The completed application will contribute to the field of computer vision and image processing and will provide a useful tool for individuals and organizations seeking a secure and contactless way to sign documents.
